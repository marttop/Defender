## Goal

Your main challenge for this game will be to create nice and
smooth user interface and menus.

Your game must follow the following rules:
- The player is a builder who must defend his castle,
- Enemy waves will regularly appear from one side of the playground,
- The player must buy and place buildings on the playground grid to block/kill enemies,
- Buildings can be offensive (towers attacking) or defensive (basic walls),
- When the castle is reached by an enemy, it takes damages,

Having a pleasant user interface is one of the details that makes a good quality game, this project is the
occasion for you to try your best on that topic.
